# 🚢 Ship Performance Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes ship performance using data science techniques to improve fuel efficiency, reduce operational costs, and optimize maintenance strategies.  

## 🗂️ Dataset  
The dataset contains operational metrics of various ship types, including:  
- Speed Over Ground  
- Engine Power  
- Cargo Weight  
- Operational Cost  
- Revenue per Voyage  
- Weather Conditions  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Cost Analysis:** Identifying the most cost-effective engine types  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Understanding how operational costs vary throughout the year  
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar ships based on performance metrics  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning** (PCA, K-Means Clustering, StandardScaler)
